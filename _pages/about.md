I am a roboticist with over 6 years of experience in research and industry, and I am particularly interested in the challenges associated with deploying teams of collaborative robots in the real world. **Currently**, I am developing the perception and navigation pipeline for [Provectus Robotics](https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/company/subsidiaries/provectus-robotics-solutions), a company that specializes in off-road autonomy for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Prior to that, I obtained my **Ph.D. from McGill University** at the [DECAR Group](https://www.decar.ca) under the supervision of [James Forbes](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/james-forbes) and [Jerome Le Ny](https://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/jerome.le-ny/). My research focused on the practical and scalable utilization of ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for multi-robot navigation, which led to various [publications](publications).

I have further strengthened my knowledge through many rewarding experiences, including teaching a [graduate course on navigation systems](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/systemes-de-navigation) at Polytechnique Montreal and participating in the EU's [Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/) while at the Technical University of Munich. My work ethic and contributions have been acknowledged in various ways, including $300k+ in personal awards and scholarships, $440k+ in grants with my colleagues, and having my paper be one of 3 "Best Paper Award" finalists among 4056 submissions at [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra) 2021. A more in-depth summary of my experiences and awards can be found in my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
